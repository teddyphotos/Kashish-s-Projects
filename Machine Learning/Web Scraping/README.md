# Web Scraping

This repository was created when I was learning various concepts that are useful in Machine Learning and Data Science in general.
One of the concept which was very essential was Data Collection which forms the first step in Machine Learning Pipeline. 
One of the ways of Data Collection is through Web Scraping which is collection data from Web Pages through Python Libraries and storing them in tables for manipulation.

#### In these projects, I've made significant use of libraries such as BeautifulSoup4 to scrape webpages and store them in Pandas DataFrames for cleaning and furthur analysis.

Each project give detailed explanation of objective and steps along with any reports that were created from it.
